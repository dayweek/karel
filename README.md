My little OpenGL demo
---------------------

It's a robotic hand that transports boxes and builds a house according to config file.

Prerequsities (on Ubuntu):
gcc
cmake >= 2.8.2
libsdl1.2.dev
libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

and an OpenGL capable card.

Compilation: In the same directory where this README is run:
cmake . && make

To execute:
cd build/ && ./karel

Enjoy!

This is my school project. The aim of the course I attend is to learn fundamentals of OpenGL.

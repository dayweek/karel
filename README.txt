My little openGL demo.

Prerequsities (on Ubuntu):
gcc
cmake >= 2.8.2
libsdl1.2.dev
libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

and an openGL capable card.

Compilation: In the same directory where this README is run:
cmake . && make

To execute:
cd build/ && ./karel

Enjoy!

This is my school project. The aim of the course I attend is to learn fundamentals of openGL.
